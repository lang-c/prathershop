                    Prather Pet Shop is named after my nanny. In this sometimes chaotic world, I like to look back to a time where life seemed much simpler, right at my nanny's side. She lived out in the country where the congestion of suburbia could not infiltrate, and where, for a long time, felt like home. Having since grown up in the rustle and bustle of big cities, I feel a connection to both worlds and hope to convey this feeling through my work. My dream of opening a shop stems from my dog mom mentality and the enjoyment of accessorizing my pets. It doesn't matter if we are out at a patio lunch with friends or just taking a walk down the street, I love adding a little something extra on my four legged friends. Coupled with my desire to express some creativity, I took in my mom and sisterâ€™s old sewing machines and was able to curate my own collection. The road so far has also opened my eyes to the wonderful art of leatherwork. This shop represents my newfound passions, and I am humbled to be able to share them. Thanks to the support of friends and family, I am making this dream of mine a reality. I hope you all enjoy!<br>
                    <br>
                    With Love,<br>
                    <br>
